== Autostart
There are some things launched at start (link:./autostart.lua[autostart.lua]), you probably want to remove some of these (or even remove them all)

|===
|Thing launched|Why?

|xrdb
|Load xresources at startup

|setxkbmap
|Replace caps lock with escape

|pulseaudio
|Audio

|mpd
|So ncmpcpp works

|mpDris2
|Playerctl support for mpd

|redshift-gtk
|Saving my eyes

|===

== Dependencies
You probably want to change these.
There are also somethings launched in autostart.lua so you may want to remove some of them or remove the file completelyfootnote:["If you are removing the file remember to also remove the require in rc.lua"] or change something.
