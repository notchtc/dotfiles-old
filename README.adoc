:toc: preamble

These are my *very horrible* dotfiles.

(screenshot coming soon i'm too lazy)

IMPORTANT: Look through README's to find out about dependencies/required application versions.

[CAUTION]
====
You probably *will* and *must* change something in my dotfiles.

I recommend looking through these dotfiles and changing things to fit your setup and/or needs if you want to use this.

It's not my fault if something doesn't work for you.
