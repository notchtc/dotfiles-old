=== Applications
These are applications that can be launched by the application menu.
They are set in the config file with the command option.

- Firefox
- Gimp
- Xonotic (SDL)
- Neovim (with alacritty)

== Bindings
They are all stored in the config and are quite readable.

Maybe someday when I stop being lazy I will turn this them into a table here.
