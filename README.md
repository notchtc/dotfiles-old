# Cha0t1c's Dotfiles
This repo is used for keeping my own dotfiles and so you can use them too if You want.

## Things you need
- zsh
   - [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
      - [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
      - [zsh-vim-mode](https://github.com/softmoth/zsh-vim-mode)
      - [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
   - [ufetch](https://gitlab.com/jschx/ufetch) (Preferably installed in **~/.local/bin** under the name **ufetch.sh**, so that you don't need to change the .zshrc file)
- xdotool (To enter normal vim-mode)
- A font that supports glyphs. [MesloLGS NF](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/blob/master/README.md#meslo-nerd-font-patched-for-powerlevel10k) is the one I use. (And you should probably use too)
- A terminal, obviously. (Rxvt-unicode is the one that I use and my .xresources file is made for.)

And I think that's all you need, also be ready to use vim keybindings in the terminal or just remove the zsh-vim-mode plugin.
