# Cha0t1c's Dotfiles
This repo is used for keeping my own dotfiles and so you can use them too if You want.\
[Screenshots](#screenshots) are at the bottom
## Things you need to use every dotfile
- Rxvt-unicode
- zsh
   - [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
      - [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
         - The [MesloLGS NF](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/blob/master/README.md#meslo-nerd-font-patched-for-powerlevel10k) font
      - [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
   - neofetch
- Neovim (to use the neovim config file, obviously)
   - [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)  (The Neovim config file downloads this automatically)
- i3
   - polybar

Note: I assume that you know something about ~~GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus~~ Linux.
I highly recommend using the things mentioned in [Things you need](#things-you-need), unless you want to do some editing.
### Useful aliases
- apt aliases (If you aren't using a Debian based distro, just delete them or change their commands and names)
   - apt-install (Installs packages, obviously)
   - apt-remove (Uninstalls packages)
   - apt-clean (Does autoremove)
   - apt-update (Updates everything)
   - ppa-add (Adds ppa's)
   - ppa-update (Updates them)
- filec (Counts all the files in a directory except **.**, **..** and **symlinks**)
- e (Opens Neovim or something different if you changed it in the .ea file)
- src (Basically source but shorter)
